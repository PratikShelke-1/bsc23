Project documentation can be implemented using : MkDocs for building static pages, 
mkdocstrings for auto-generating documentation from docstrings in code, 
Material for MkDocs for styling the documentation 

Docstring: Python docstrings are the string literals that appear right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module. 
We can access these docstrings using the __doc__ attribute. Whenever string literals are present just after the definition of a 
function, module, class or method, they are associated with the object as their __doc__ attribute. 

MkDocs: MkDocs is a popular open-source static site generator specifically designed for creating project documentation. 
It allows users to write documentation content in Markdown, a lightweight markup language, and then converts those Markdown files into a static website.
